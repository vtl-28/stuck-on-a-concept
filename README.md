## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

This project is intended to solve a problem faced by SE students enrolled in
the ALX SE programme. The problem is that a lot of students enrolled in the
SE programme are new to programming and often have a difficult time getting
support to complete the difficult projects and tasks assigned to the students.
And as a result, unfortunately, drop out of the programme. This project will
give struggling SE students the support they need to complete projects and
tasks by allowing them to post about coding challenges they facing in order to
seek help solving them, and by also searching for answers to problems they
are facing that maybe other students have also faced and managed to solve

- What the Portfolio Project will not solve: This project will not reduce the staggering number of students failing to
complete this programme
- Who the Portfolio Project will help and/or who the users will be: This project will help students enrolled in the ALX SE programme

          RISK

- Technical risks: Technology to be used for this project may not be suitable for the project later
when it is scaled up.
The potential impact of the project will be using a programming language for
the project, and getting stuck in the middle of the project. This may mean
using another programming language for the entire project.

- Non-technical risks: Data breaches and security issues that may arise due to using data of users.
Data compliance securities and certification will be needed to enhance data
protection.

As a student of the ALX software engineering program, I want to be able to seek
for help on a coding challenge I am facing by searching for similar coding
challenges that have been solved before by someone else, so that I can get an
idea of how to solve the coding challenge I am faced with on a project I am
working on


## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Using Django‚Äôs built-in development server, we will populate our app with data by configuring our Django app database with SQLite3. We will use manage.py in Django to test our codebase and the server to test our URLs.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
