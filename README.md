## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

This project aims to address a problem faced by students enrolled in the ALX SE program. Many new programming students struggle to find support for completing the challenging projects and tasks assigned to them. This often leads to frustration and, unfortunately, dropping out of the program.

This project provides SE students with the support they need to complete their projects and tasks. It allows them to post about the coding challenges they are facing to seek help and to search for solutions to problems that other students may have encountered and solved.


          RISK

- Technical risks: Technology to be used for this project may not be suitable for the project later
when it is scaled up.
The potential impact of the project will be using a programming language for
the project, and getting stuck in the middle of the project. This may mean
using another programming language for the entire project.

- Non-technical risks: Data breaches and security issues that may arise due to using data of users.
Data compliance securities and certification will be needed to enhance data
protection.

As a student of the ALX software engineering program, I want to seek help with a coding challenge I am facing by searching for similar challenges that have been previously solved by others. This way, I can get ideas and guidance on how to address the coding challenge in my current project.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Using Django‚Äôs built-in development server, we will populate our app with data by configuring our Django app database with SQLite3. We will use manage.py in Django to test our codebase and the server to test our URLs.
